## Introduction

The **Mega Case Study** is divided into multiple parts, each covering a distinct machine learning or deep learning technique. The primary objective is to build a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of different algorithms.

### Part 1: Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

The first part of this case study focuses on implementing a **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**. SOMs are a type of unsupervised learning method used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.

### Objectives
- Understand and implement SOM for clustering.
- Analyze the clusters and interpret the results.
- Prepare the output of SOM for further processing in subsequent parts of the case study.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- `Mega_Case_Study.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the code and explanations.
- `data/`: A directory (to be created) that stores the dataset(s) used in the project.
- `models/`: A directory (to be created) that stores the trained models (if applicable).
- `results/`: A directory (to be created) for saving visualizations, metrics, and other output data.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install several Python packages. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib MiniSom
```

These packages are used for data manipulation (`numpy`, `pandas`), visualization (`matplotlib`), and implementing SOM (`MiniSom`).

## Data Preparation

This section outlines how to prepare your data for analysis.

1. **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset into your notebook using `pandas`.
   - Ensure the dataset is clean and pre-processed (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing features).
2. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and characteristics. Visualize the data using `matplotlib`.

Here is a basic template for loading and inspecting your dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')

# Inspect the dataset
print(data.head())
print(data.describe())
print(data.info())
```

## Model Building

### Part 1: Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

In this part, you'll implement a SOM to identify clusters in your data.

#### Step 1: Install the MiniSom Package

If you haven't installed it already, use the following command:

```bash
pip install MiniSom
```

#### Step 2: Initialize and Train the SOM

Here's a basic example of how to initialize and train a SOM using the `MiniSom` library:

```python
from minisom import MiniSom

# Initialize the SOM
som = MiniSom(x=10, y=10, input_len=data.shape[1], sigma=1.0, learning_rate=0.5)

# Normalize the data
data_normalized = (data - data.min()) / (data.max() - data.min())

# Train the SOM
som.train_random(data_normalized.values, num_iteration=100)
```

#### Step 3: Visualize the SOM Output

Visualizing the SOM output can help you interpret the clusters formed by the SOM:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the SOM
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i, x in enumerate(data_normalized.values):
    w = som.winner(x)
    plt.text(w[0] + 0.5, w[1] + 0.5, str(i), color=plt.cm.rainbow(i / len(data)),
             fontdict={'weight': 'bold', 'size': 12})
plt.show()
```

## Evaluation

After training the SOM, evaluate its performance by analyzing the clusters and how well the data points are grouped. You can use various metrics and visualizations to assess the quality of the clusters.

### Example: Evaluating Cluster Quality

You can assess the cluster quality by comparing it with labels (if available) or by visual inspection of the map.

## Usage

To use the Jupyter notebook:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure that all required packages are installed (see [Installation](#installation) section).
4. Open the notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Mega_Case_Study.ipynb
```

5. Run the cells step by step to follow along with the implementation.

## Results

This section is where you will document your findings after running the notebook. For example, you can include:

- **Visualizations**: Display the SOM output, showing how data points are clustered.
- **Insights**: Discuss the significance of the clusters and what they reveal about the data.
- **Metrics**: If applicable, include evaluation metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares or silhouette scores.

Example:

```markdown
### SOM Clustering Results

After training the SOM, the data points were clustered into several groups. The following visualization shows the clustering results:

**Insights**:
- Cluster 1 represents customers with high credit card usage.
- Cluster 2 groups customers with lower spending habits.
